# Production Readiness Checklist

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Order Status Implementation
- [x] **New order statuses implemented:**
  - `pending_payment` - ‚è≥ –û–∂–∏–¥–∞–µ—Ç –æ–ø–ª–∞—Ç—ã
  - `payment_received` - üí∞ –û–ø–ª–∞—á–µ–Ω, –æ–∂–∏–¥–∞–µ—Ç –ø–æ–¥—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è
  - `confirmed` - üë©‚Äçüç≥ –ì–æ—Ç–æ–≤–ª—é –≤–∞—à –∑–∞–∫–∞–∑
  - `ready` - üéâ –ì–æ—Ç–æ–≤ –∫ –≤—ã–¥–∞—á–µ
  - `completed` - ‚úÖ –ó–∞–∫–∞–∑ –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω
  - `cancelled_by_client` - ‚ùå –û—Ç–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω –≤–∞–º–∏
  - `cancelled_by_master` - ‚ùå –û—Ç–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω –º–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ä–æ–º
